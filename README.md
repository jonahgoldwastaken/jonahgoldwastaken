### I build enticing experiences that keep your users hooked

I am Jonah, a Interaction Design and Developer student based in Amsterdam. I like good design, good code and good things that make the world a better place.

I currently just focus on my studies, but am always open to dabble with exciting and refreshing ideas. Check out my portfolio at [jonahgold.dev](https://jonahgold.dev)!
